title: "About me"
---

I am an Artificial Intelligence researcher at the [Research Centre in Intelligent Technologies (CiTIUS)](http://www.citius.usc.es/), currently working on object detection and image classification using **computer vision** and **deep learning** techniques.

I received my **PhD in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence** from the [University of Santiago de Compostela](http://www.usc.es/) in 2020. My research was centered in safe **motion planning** and **autonomous navigation** for mobile robots and UAVs. I have also been with the [Human Machine Interaction (HMI)](https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/hmi/) group at the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/), working on socially aware motion planning.
